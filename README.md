I had a task write a code which get any possible string as input and check if there is date pattern like "DD:MM:YY HH:MM:SS" if yes that string is valid.
Then I should be writing test script which should parse input from Json and compare actual and expected results and return comparison results.

I developed a project based on OOP concepts you can find other details in the docstrings of the file.
